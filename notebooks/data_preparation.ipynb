      "emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electrons, are often observed [1], [2]. In\n",
      "astrophysics, much more energetic electrons have been discussed. From the observations of\n",

      "produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [3], [4]. It is also believed that in the\n",

      "the same mechanism.\n",

      "Electron acceleration has been an important issue in plasma physics and astrophysics. In\n",
      "solar physics, for instance, the acceleration of electrons as well as of ions has received a great\n",
      "deal of attention; in solar ﬂares, gamma rays with energies o f several tens of MeV, which are\n",
      "emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electro ns, are often observed [1], [2]. In\n",
      "astrophysics, much more energetic electrons have been disc ussed. From the observations of\n",
      "X-rays and gamma rays, it is now believed that electrons with energies up to ∼100 TeV are\n",
      "produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [3], [4]. It is also believed that in the\n",
      "Crab Nebula high-energy electrons accelerated up to ∼100 TeV are produced by the pulsar\n",
      "wind [5]. Theories based on the Fermi acceleration model hav e been proposed to account for\n",
      "these high-energy phenomena [6], [7]. As for laboratory pla smas, in an attempt to realize\n",
      "plasma-based accelerators, the electron acceleration in a relativistic space charge wave has\n",
      "been intensively studied by simulations and experiments [8 ].\n",
      "Ion acceleration in a magnetosonic wave has been studied by m any authors [9]- [22].\n",
      "In a single-ion-species plasma, the large positive potenti al formed in the shock region can\n",
      "reﬂect some ions and give great energies to them [9]- [18]. In a multi-ion-species plasma\n",
      "such as space plasmas, some of the majority ions (hydrogen) c an also gain energies by\n",
      "the same mechanism. Furthermore, the transverse electric ﬁ eld in the shock wave can\n",
      "accelerate all particles of all kinds of (minority) heavy io ns to nearly the same speed [19],\n",
      "[20]. In addition, in a turbulent plasma where particles can interact with many diﬀerent\n",

      "deal of attention; in solar ﬂares, gamma rays with energies o f several tens of MeV, which are\n",
      "emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electro ns, are often observed [1], [2]. In\n",
      "astrophysics, much more energetic electrons have been disc ussed. From the observations of\n",
      "X-rays and gamma rays, it is now believed that electrons with energies up to ∼100 TeV are\n",
      "produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [3], [4]. It is also believed that in the\n",
      "Crab Nebula high-energy electrons accelerated up to ∼100 TeV are produced by the pulsar\n",
      "wind [5]. Theories based on the Fermi acceleration model hav e been proposed to account for\n",
      "these high-energy phenomena [6], [7]. As for laboratory pla smas, in an attempt to realize\n",
      "plasma-based accelerators, the electron acceleration in a relativistic space charge wave has\n",
      "been intensively studied by simulations and experiments [8 ].\n",
      "Ion acceleration in a magnetosonic wave has been studied by m any authors [9]- [22].\n",
      "In a single-ion-species plasma, the large positive potenti al formed in the shock region can\n",
      "reﬂect some ions and give great energies to them [9]- [18]. In a multi-ion-species plasma\n",
      "such as space plasmas, some of the majority ions (hydrogen) c an also gain energies by\n",
      "the same mechanism. Furthermore, the transverse electric ﬁ eld in the shock wave can\n",
      "accelerate all particles of all kinds of (minority) heavy io ns to nearly the same speed [19],\n",
      "[20]. In addition, in a turbulent plasma where particles can interact with many diﬀerent\n",

      "a diﬀerent mechanism [21]. These processes have been extens ively studied by theory and\n",

INTRODUCTION Electron acceleration has been an important issue in plasma physics and astrophysics . In solar physics , for instance , the acceleration of electrons as well as of ions has received a great deal of attention ; in solar ﬂares , gamma rays with energies o f several tens of MeV , which are emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electro ns , are often observed [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . In astrophysics , much more energetic electrons have been disc ussed . From the observations of X-rays and gamma rays , it is now believed that electrons with energies up to ∼100 TeV are produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . It is also believed that in the Crab Nebula high-energy electrons accelerated up to ∼100 TeV are produced by the pulsar wind [ 5 ] . Theories based on the Fermi acceleration model hav e been proposed to account for these high-energy phenomena [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . As for laboratory pla smas , in an attempt to realize plasma-based accelerators , the electron acceleration in a relativistic space charge wave has been intensively studied by simulations and experiments [ 8 ] . Ion acceleration in a magnetosonic wave has been studied by m any authors [ 9 ] - [ 22 ] . In a single-ion-species plasma , the large positive potenti al formed in the shock region can reﬂect some ions and give great energies to them [ 9 ] - [ 18 ] . In a multi-ion-species plasma such as space plasmas , some of the majority ions ( hydrogen ) c an also gain energies by the same mechanism . Furthermore , the transverse electric ﬁ eld in the shock wave can accelerate all particles of all kinds of ( minority ) heavy io ns to nearly the same speed [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] . In addition , in a turbulent plasma where particles can interact with many diﬀerent large-amplitude magnetosonic pulses , some energetic ions can be further accelerated by a diﬀerent mechanism [ 21 ] . These processes have been extens ively studied by theory and particle simulation by many authors and have been applied to the production of high-energy particles in solar ﬂares and interplanetary shocks [ 9 ] - [ 20 ] . Strong electron acceleration in shock waves , however , has n ot been shown by particle simulations . In this paper we will theoretically and numeri cally study electron motion in a magnetosonic shock wave propagating obliquely to a magnet ic ﬁeld . We will show that an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic electrons . The preliminary result has been reported in Ref . [ 23 ] . In Sec . II , we outline some basic properties of oblique shock s. In Sec . III , we theoretically discuss the possibility of electron reﬂection . If electron s are reﬂected near the end of the main pulse , then after the reﬂection they can have great ener gies in the main pulse . Several authors discussed stationary pulse solutions for t he nonlinear magnetosonic waves [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] . However , if the magnetic ﬁeld is rather strong so thatωce/ωpe > ∼1 , where ωce is the electron cyclotron frequency and ωpeis the plasma frequency , or if the amplitude is quite large , then the pulse propagation is not perfectly sta tionary [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ; small-amplitude ﬂuctuations are generated in and around the main pulse . Even though the potential is positive in the main pulse in a shock wave , the electron reﬂec tion studied in this paper can occur in such a non-stationary pulse . In Sec . IV , we estimate the maximum energy of a reﬂected elect ron and discuss its dependence on plasma parameters . In Sec . V , we further study the electron acceleration by using a one-dimensional ( one space coordinate and three vel ocity components ) , relativistic , electromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion an d electron dynamics . It will be shown that some electrons can be reﬂected near the end of the m ain pulse and are trapped 2 in the shock region . In the simulations , an appreciable numb er of electrons have energies γ > 100 , where γis the Lorentz factor . Further , we will examine the dependen ce ofγon the propagation angle and shock speed . It is veriﬁed that , as the theory predicts , there are special angles and shock speeds at which the electron acceleration i s especially strong . Our work is summarized in Sec . VI . In Appendix A , we describe relations a mong physical quantities in a magnetosonic wave . In Appendix B , we give a rough estimate fo r the magnitude of parallel electric ﬁeld E║on the basis of a simple physical picture . II . VELOCITIES AND FIELDS IN AN OBLIQUE WAVE We consider a magnetosonic wave propagating in the xdirection with a speed vshin an external magnetic ﬁeld in the ( x , z ) plane . We assume that the ﬁeld quantities depend onxonly ; ∂/∂y =∂/∂z = 0 . Then , from the equation ∇ ·B= 0 , it follows that the xcomponent of the magnetic ﬁeld is constant , Bx=Bx0 . The other components Byand Bzare functions of x , and in the pulse region Byas well as Bzcan have ﬁnite values . In the wave frame where the time derivatives are zero ( ∂/∂t= 0 ) , the electric ﬁeld in the y direction is constant , Ey=Ey0 , and Ezis zero . Hence we have B= ( Bx0 , By , Bz ) and E= ( Ex , Ey0,0 ) . In Sections II-IV , theoretical analyses will be made mai nly in the wave frame . The velocity of the guiding-center position of an electron , vg , may be written as vg= ( B/B ) v║+vd , ( 1 ) withvdbeing the drift velocity vd=cE×B/B2− ( cµ/e ) ( B× ∇B ) /B2 . ( 2 ) Herecis the speed of light , −eis the electron charge ( e > 0 ) , v║is the velocity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld , and µis the magnetic moment µ=mev2 ⊥/ ( 2B ) , ( 3 ) withmethe electron mass and v⊥the gyration speed perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld . In the far upstream region , we have no ∇B-drift . Also , the zcomponent of the velocity averaged over all the electrons in a small volume element mus t be zero , < vgz0 > = 0 ; the subscript 0 refers to the quantities in the far upstream regi on . Accordingly , from the z component of Eq . ( 1 ) we have the average parallel velocity < v║0 > =cEy0 B0Bx0 Bz0 , ( 4 ) in the wave frame ( see Fig . 1 ) . Also , because < vgx0 > =−vsh , thexcomponent of Eq . ( 1 ) gives vsh=−Bx0 B0 < v║0 > −cEy0Bz0 B2 0 . ( 5 ) ThusEy0is related to the shock speed vshthrough 3 Ey0=−vshBz0/c . ( 6 ) For the deﬁniteness , we assume that Bx0 , Bz0andvshare all positive ; and thus Ey0 < 0 . The nonlinear wave theory tells us the wave structure . A shoc k wave will have a positive electric potential ϕ ( x ) . The quantities ϕ , Bz , ni , and nehave similar proﬁles [ 28 ] - [ 29 ] ( see Appendix A ) ; here ni , and neare the ion and electron densities , respectively . On the oth er hand , ExandByare proportional to the xderivatives of these quantities ; for instance , Ex=−∂ϕ/∂x . These relations among the quantities are obtained for smal l-amplitude waves . In the following theoretical analysis , we assume tha t the relations are also valid for large-amplitude waves . As we will see later in Fig . 7 , simula tion results also support this assumption . We denote by xmthexposition at which the potential takes its maximum value ; hen ce , Ex ( xm ) ≃0 and By ( xm ) ≃0 . For later use , we also note that the quantity Bz/Btakes its maximum value at x=xm ; that is , if Bz ( x ) is smaller than Bz ( xm ) , then Bz ( xm ) 2 B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2 > Bz ( x ) 2 B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2 . ( 7 ) This can be proved by the following equation Bz ( xm ) 2 B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2= [ Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 ] B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2By ( x ) 2 [ B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2 ] [ B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2 ] . ( 8 ) Because Bz ( xm ) is the maximum value of Bz ( x ) , the term [ Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 ] B2 x0is positive . Hence the right-hand side of the above equation is positive . We know the stationary , ﬁnite-amplitude solutions for perp endicular waves [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] . The stationary solitary wave solution is valid when the magneti c ﬁeld is weak , ωce/ωpe < < 1 , and when the wave amplitude is not large , 1 < M < 2 , where Mis the Alfv´ en Mach number ; M=vsh/vAwithvAthe Alfv´ en speed , v2 A=B2 0/ ( 4πnimi ) . Simulations and experiments show that large-amplitude pulses can propagate nearly stea dily , even when the amplitudes are large or the magnetic ﬁelds are strong . Oblique pulses ca n also propagate nearly steadily . As the magnetic ﬁeld becomes stronger or the wave amplitude i s increased , non-stationary eﬀects will become important [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . III . ELECTRON REFLECTION Because the potential is usually positive in the shock regio n , some of the ions can be reﬂected when they go up the potential . As we will see later , e lectrons can also be reﬂected ; its mechanism is , however , diﬀerent from that of ion reﬂecti on . We give a physical picture of the electron reﬂection . From the nonrelativistic equation of motion for an electron medv dt=−e ( E+v×B c ) , ( 9 ) we have an equation for the kinetic energy in the wave frame 4 me ( v2−v2 0 ) /2 =e ( ϕ−ϕ0 ) −eEy0∫ vydt . ( 10 ) Here we have used the relation Ez= 0 . The velocity vincludes gyro , parallel , and drift motions . We deﬁne length sas ds= ( B/B x0 ) vgxdt , ( 11 ) where vgxis the xcomponent of the electron velocity vgx= ( Bx0/B ) v║+vdx , ( 12 ) ( see Fig . 2 ) . Thus d s/dtis given by ds dt=v║+B Bx0vdx . ( 13 ) We can interpret d sas an inﬁnitesimal length along the ﬁeld line corresponding to the length dx=vgxdt ; ds= ( B/B x0 ) dx . In general the guiding-center velocity vgis not parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B . Hence the guiding center does not move along the ﬁeld line . F or a stationary , one-dimensional problem ( ∂/∂t= 0 and ∂/∂y=∂/∂z= 0 ) , all quantities depend only on x . As a result , for any stationary function f ( x ) we have ∫x2 x1f ( x ) ( B/B x0 ) dx=∫s2 s1f ( s ) ds , ( 14 ) where s1ands2are the positions along the same ﬁeld line ; their xpositions are x1andx2 , respectively . If we deﬁne quantity Fas E║=−dF/ds , ( 15 ) then with the aid of ( 11 ) and the relation E║=E·B/B , we have F=−∫ ( ExBx0+Ey0By ) BB Bx0dx , ( 16 ) which can be written as F=−∫/parenleftbigg Ex−vshBz0By cBx0/parenrightbigg dx . ( 17 ) Using the electric potential ϕand the vector potential A ( B=∇ ×A ) , we ﬁnd F=ϕ− ( vsh/c ) ( Bz0/Bx0 ) Az , ( 18 ) where Azis the zcomponent of the vector potential , Az=−∫ Bydx . ( 19 ) 5 The quantities ϕandBzhave similar proﬁles , while Byis proportional to ∂Bz/∂x [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . Hence AzandFhave proﬁles similar to ϕ . If we deﬁne quantity Flin the laboratory frame ( the subscript ldenotes the laboratory frame ) as Fl=−∫ El║ ( Bl/Blx0 ) dxl , ( 20 ) then for a stationary , one-dimensional problem , that is , fo r a case where wave proﬁles can be written as f ( xl , tl ) =f ( xl−vshtl ) , we ﬁnd Fl=−∫/parenleftbigg Elx−vshBlz0Bly cBlx0/parenrightbigg dxl . ( 21 ) One can readily show that it is related to Fin the wave frame as F=γshFl , ( 22 ) where γshis deﬁned as γsh= ( 1−v2 sh/c2 ) −1/2 . ( 23 ) In Appendix B , we give a rough estimate of the maximum value of F , Eq . ( B9 ) , found from qualitative physical considerations . Combining Eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 18 ) , we eliminate ϕ mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) − ( eEy0/Bx0 ) ( Az−Az0+∫ vyBx0dt ) . ( 24 ) By virtue of the deﬁnition of Az , ( 19 ) , and the relation d x=vxdt , this equation can be written as mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) +e ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ∫ ( vxBy−vyBx0 ) dt . ( 25 ) Then , using the zcomponent of the equation of motion , we ﬁnd mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( vz−vz0 ) . ( 26 ) In the drift approximation , the kinetic energy can be expres sed as mev2/2 =me ( v2 ║+v2 d ) /2 +µB . ( 27 ) Hence , averaging Eq . ( 26 ) over the electron cyclotron perio d , we have ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║+v2 d ) +µB+mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) vgz−eF = ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║0+v2 d0 ) +µB0+mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) vz0−eF0 . ( 28 ) With the aid of the zcomponent of Eq . ( 1 ) , we can eliminate vgzand obtain the following equation 6 ( me/2 ) ( v║−vrv ) 2+K=e ( F−F0 ) −µ ( B−B0 ) + ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║0+v2 d0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( vdz−vz0 ) − ( me/2 ) v2 d , ( 29 ) where vrvandKare deﬁned as vrv=−cEy0Bz/ ( Bx0B ) ( > 0 ) , ( 30 ) K=−mev2 rv/2 ( < 0 ) . ( 31 ) If we eliminate Ey0by substituting Eq . ( 6 ) in Eq . ( 30 ) , vrvcan be expressed as vrv=vshBz0Bz/ ( Bx0B ) . ( 32 ) We will see below that the velocity vgxis reversed when v║=vrv . In the pulse region , the quantity e ( F−F0 ) can be much larger in magnitude than the other terms on the ri ght-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) ( see Appendix B ) . We denote the left-hand sid e of Eq . ( 29 ) by Ee , i.e. , Ee= ( me/2 ) ( v║−vrv ) 2+K . As shown in Fig . 3 , at a ﬁxed point x , Eehas its minimum value Kwhen v║=vrv . It is negative in the region 0 < v║ < 2vrv . ( 33 ) Because vdx=cEy0Bz/B2 , it follows from Eq . ( 12 ) that vgx= 0 if v║=vrv . As can be seen from Eq . ( 4 ) , most of the electrons have negative parall el velocities in the far upstream region . Accordingly , we suppose that the initial parallel v elocity is negative , v║ < 0 . If v║gradually increases and exceeds vrvat a certain position , then the xcomponent of the guiding center velocity , vgx , changes from negative to positive values there , i.e. , it is reversed . As an electron moves , i.e. , as xchanges , the quantities K , F , B , etc . also vary . At any point x , Kis the minimum value of the left-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) . If ther e is a region where the values of the right-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) become smaller t hanK , then the electron can not enter there ; it will be reﬂected . We recall that ϕ , F , and Bzhave similar proﬁles and that at x=xmthe quantity ( Bz/B ) has a maximum value [ see Eq . ( 7 ) ] . Because Kis proportional to ( Bz/B ) 2 , it will be quite small ( |K|is large ) around the point x=xm , and Fis large . In front of or behind the main pulse , Fis relatively small and Kis relatively large ; e ( F−F0 ) could be smaller than K. Thus , if the electron reﬂection occurs , it will be in such regions . In quasi-perpendicular shocks , where ( Bz0/Bx0 ) > > 1 , vrvis large . Hence Khas large negative values . Thus the electron reﬂection in this mechan ism will be diﬃcult . Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of the trajectory of guidi ng center . Here it is assumed that the reﬂection takes place at point D ; the dotted line sho ws the orbit of a passing electron . As an electron moves from point A to C , it moves to the negative ydirection because of the Ex×Bzdrift . It gains kinetic energy ∆ E1from the electric potential ∆E1=eϕ ( xC ) −eϕ ( xA ) ( > 0 ) . ( 34 ) At the same time , it loses energy ∆ E2because of the electric ﬁeld Ey0 ∆E2=−eEy0 ( yC−yA ) ( < 0 ) . ( 35 ) 7 The net change in the energy is therefore ∆E= ∆E1+ ∆E2 . ( 36 ) Even though the magnitudes of ∆ E1and ∆ E2are quite large , they almost cancel when an electron moves with drift approximation ; in particular , in a perpendicular pulse they have exactly the same magnitude and ∆ E= 0 [ 30 ] . However , if an electron is reﬂected and moves from D to E , then it would gain energies from both ExandEy0 . As a result , the increase in energy is ∆E= ∆E1+ ∆E3 , ( 37 ) where ∆ E3is deﬁned as ∆E3=−eEy0 ( yE−yA ) ( > 0 ) . ( 38 ) IV . ESTIMATE OF ENERGY INCREASE Next , we will obtain the maximum energy of a reﬂected electro n. Because it can have quite high energy , we will use the relativistic equation of m otion med ( γv ) dt=−e ( E+v×B c ) , ( 39 ) where γis the Lorentz factor . For the stationary , one-dimensional system being considered , this can be integrated to give the energy conservation equat ion meγc2−meγ0c2=e ( ϕ−ϕ0 ) −eEy0∫ vydt . ( 40 ) This is a relativistic form of Eq . ( 10 ) . Again , using the quan titiesF , Az , and the equation of motion , we can rewrite Eq . ( 40 ) as meγc2−meγ0c2=e ( F−F0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( γvz−γ0vz0 ) . ( 41 ) If we deﬁne quantity has h=mec2−mevshBz0vz/Bx0 , ( 42 ) then from Eq . ( 41 ) we have γ= [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] /h . ( 43 ) Equation ( 42 ) indicates that his positive if Bz0/Bx0is of order unity . If Bz0/Bx0is much greater than unity , then hcan be negative . In addition , Eq . ( 43 ) shows that , if the init ial value of his positive , h0 > 0 , then his always positive in the region where ( F−F0 ) is positive . 8 We show in Fig . 5 schematic diagram of the function [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] . We suppose thatFhas a maximum value at x=xmand has a minimum value right behind the main pulse . If the reﬂection occurs , it would be in this dip , as sug gested in the previous section . The reﬂection point will be denoted by xr . In the top panel this function e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0is always positive . In the second one it becomes negative right behind the main pulse ; however its maximum value is positive ( h0can be either positive or negative ) . In the bottom one it is always negative . For the present acceleration mechani sm , the top panel is the most important ; the strong acceleration takes place in this case . Such dips would not be present in the perfectly stationary so lutions [ 24 ] - [ 29 ] . In large- amplitude magnetosonic waves , however , non-stationary di ps can be generated [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . We here just assume that there is a dip behind the main pulse an d discuss its eﬀects on particle orbits . First we consider the top panel in Fig . 5 : An electron with pos itiveh0is reﬂected at a certain point near the end of the main pulse . We will show that , after the reﬂection , hhas its minimum ( positive ) value at x=xm ; hence γhas its maximum value there . As mentioned earlier , the parallel velocity v║is already positive when an electron is reﬂected , i.e. , when vgxis reversed , even if its initial value is negative . After the reﬂection , v║will be increased by the ( positive ) parallel electric force . Because E║changes its sign at x=xm , v║will have a maximum value at x=xm ( unless vxchanges to negative values again before reaching the point xm ) . The parallel velocity will become the dominant component in the electron velocity , v∼v║B/B . The quantity Bz/Bas well as ϕandBzhas a maximum value at this point . Thus vz , which can be approximated as vz∼v║Bz/B , will also have the maximum value there . Because h0and ( Fm−F0 ) are both positive , his positive at x=xm . In addition , Eq . ( 42 ) indicates that hdecreases ( draws closer to zero ) as vzincreases . Hence , hof a reﬂected electron will have a minimum positive value at x=xm . Its energy γwill therefore have a maximum value there . If hcan be close to zero , then γwould become quite large . IfBx0is small and vz0has a large positive value , then h0becomes small ( can be even negative ) . We now consider such particles ; the second panel in Fig . 5 . Also in this case , vzwill have larger values after the reﬂection ; thus hwill decrease . At the reﬂection point in the dip , the quantity [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] is negative . Consequently , h ( xr ) < 0 . If the reﬂection occurs , the electron would move in the positive xdirection . Because vzincreases , hwill further decrease . Hence , the particle would never be ab le to penetrate the region again where hγ > 0 . The strong acceleration in this mechanism , therefore , wi ll not take place . Next , we consider a case where the quantity [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] is always negative ( the bottom panel in Fig . 5 ) . Then , his always negative . If the reﬂection occurs at x=xr , then|h|would increase while |e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0|would decrease . Hence , even if the particle reaches the point xm , γwould not have an extremely large value . Therefore , the stro ng acceleration is not expected . We can estimate the maximum value γmin the wave frame by substituting the maximum value of F , Eq . ( B12 ) , in Eq . ( 43 ) . The maximum γin the laboratory frame can be obtained by the Lorentz transformation as γlm=γsh ( 1 +vxvsh/c2 ) γm≃γshγm . ( 44 ) 9 Now let us consider a case where hbecomes quite small , h≃0 , atx=xm . There the electron speed would be close to the speed of light c. Hence , roughly , we have vz∼cBz/B . The quantity hcan then be expressed as h=mec2/parenleftbigg 1−γshvsh cBz Btanθ/parenrightbigg , ( 45 ) where tan θ=Blz0/Blx0 . Here we have used the relations Bz0=γshBlz0andBx0=Blx0 . Because Bzbecomes quite large in the shock region , we may put as Bz/B∼1 . Equation ( 45 ) then suggests that the electron energy can become extre mely large when γsh ( vsh/c ) tanθ= 1 , ( 46 ) or , equivalently ccosθ=vsh . ( 47 ) V. SIMULATION STUDIES A. Simulation Method We further study the electron acceleration by using a one-di mensional ( one space co- ordinate and three velocity components ) , relativistic , el ectromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion and electron dynamics [ 31 ] . The total syst em length is Lx= 4096∆ g for most of the simulation runs , where ∆ gis the grid spacing . All lengths and velocities in the simulations were normalized to ∆ gandωpe∆g , respectively , where ωpeis the spatially averaged plasma frequency . We use a bounded plasma model . The plasma is limited to the reg ion 400 < x < 3696 . The particles are specularly reﬂected at x= 400 and at x= 3696 . The radiation leaving the plasma region is absorbed in the vacuum regions , 0 < x < 400 and 3696 < x < 4096 . Thus the electromagnetic interactions between the two plasma bo undaries through the vacuum regions are made negligibly small [ 12 ] . In most of the plasma region , i.e. , in 500 < x < 3696 , each particle species initially has a uniform density and has a Maxwellian velocity distributio n function . In the small region , 400 < x < 480 , the plasma density is four times as high as that in the mai n region . That is , the initial plasma density can be written as ne= 4n0for 400 < x < x 1 , ne= 4n0exp [ − ( x−x1 ) 2/ ( 2d2 ) ] for x1 < x < 500 , ne=n0for 500 < x < 3696 . Herex1= 480 and d= 12 . In the high-density region , 400 < x < 480 , particles have shifted Maxwellian velocity distribution functions with a verage velocity vps ; fj∼exp [ − ( v− vps ) 2/ ( 2v2 Tj ) ] , where the subscript jrefers to particle species . These particles act as a piston . They push the neighboring particles and excite a sho ck wave . We can change the 10 shock strength by changing the magnitude of vps ; the velocity vpsis perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld so that no particles have extremely l arge parallel speeds initially . More detailed description about the simulation code can be f ound in Ref . [ 12 ] . The simulation parameters are as follows . The number of simu lation particles is Ni= Ne= 262 ,144 . The ion-to-electron mass ratio is mi/me= 100 . The ratio ωce/ωpeis ωce/ωpe= 3.0 in the far upstream region . The electron and ion thermal vel ocities are vTe/c= 0.38 and vTi/c= 0.01 , respectively . The Alfv´ en speed is vA/c= 0.3 . The electron skin depth is c/ωpe= 4∆ g. The time step is suﬃciently small , ωpe∆t= 0.02 , so that ∆ tis much smaller than the plasma and cyclotron periods even in th e shock region . As in the theoretical model , the external magnetic ﬁeld is in the ( x , z ) plane , and waves propagate in the xdirection . B. Simulation Results First , we study a shock with the propagation angle θ= 45◦ ; i.e. , Bx0=Bz0 . Figure 6 shows proﬁles of Bzin the shock wave at various times . Here , the magnetic ﬁeld is normalized toBz0 . The Mach number is observed to be M= 2.3 , i.e. , the shock speed is vsh= 2.3vA . The maximum value of Bzis 4∼5 times as large as Bz0 . The main pulse propagates nearly steadily . However , the proﬁle is not perfectly stationary . Figure 7 displays ﬁeld proﬁles at ωpet= 680 ; here the magnetic and electric ﬁelds are both normalized to B0 . As the theory predicts [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , EyandBzhave similar proﬁles , while Ex , Ez , andByare quite small in magnitude at the point where Bzhas its maximum value . Figure 8 shows phase space plots of electrons at ωpet= 680 . In the shock region , ultra-relativistic electrons are produced . The maximum va lue of Lorentz factors is γ≃130 . We also see that pxandpzhave greater values than py , which is consistent with the picture that the parallel velocity is dominant in the motion of high- energy electrons . From Figs . 7 and 8 , we see that some electrons are reﬂected near the end of t he main pulse and that the high-energy electrons are present in the shock region . Figure 9 shows proﬁles of E║ , F , and the electric potential ϕatωpet= 650 and at ωpet= 680 . The quantities ˜Fand ˜ϕdenote eF/ ( mec2 ) and eϕ/ ( mec2 ) , respectively . The quantities Fandϕwere obtained in the simulation by the following equations F ( x ) =−∫x E║ ( B/B x0 ) dx , ( 48 ) ϕ ( x ) =−∫x Exdx . ( 49 ) As mentioned earlier , roughly speaking , the parallel elect ric ﬁeld E║is positive in the region where ∂Bz/∂xand∂F/∂x are negative . It is negative in the region where they are posi tive . Comparing the plots at diﬀerent times , we see that the wave pr oﬁles are not perfectly stationary . They vary with time with small-amplitudes . In p articular , as shown in the plot atωpet= 680 , Fsometimes becomes negative near the end of the main pulse , wh ere the electron reﬂection can take place . Next , we will study trajectories of electrons ; we will ﬁnd th at it is the reﬂected electrons that gain great energies . Figure 10 displays time variation s of ( x−vsht ) , y , z , and γof 11 electrons in a shock with vsh= 1.75vA ; ( x−vsht ) is the xposition in the wave frame . The lengths are normalized to the electron skin depth c/ωpe . ( Here the system size is a half of that in the previous run ; the other parameters such as Ne/Lxare the same . ) Two typical examples are presented here . The thick lines show an electro n that was accelerated , and the thin lines represent an electron that was not accelerate d ; even the low-energy electron here has energy γ≃10 in the shock region and γ≃5 behind the shock . In all of the four panels , the low- and high-energy electrons both have small- amplitude , cyclotron oscillations with short periods , ωpet < ∼20 ; note that the cyclotron period depends on γas well as the ﬁeld strength B . At the same time , the accelerated electron has a large-ampl itude , long- period oscillation with period ωpet≃170 ; it begins when the particle enters the shock , ωpet= 180 , and continues until the end of this simulation run . ( Si mulations show that this period increases with γ . To observe this oscillation as many times as possible , we ha ve chosen here the case where γis not so large . ) For comparison with Fig . 4 , we show the times corresponding to points B , C , D , and E. From the long-pe riod oscillation of ( x−vsht ) in the top panel , we see that the electron that will become hig h energy is reﬂected and then trapped by the shock wave . On the other hand , the quantity ( x−vsht ) of the low-energy electron keeps decreasing , which means that this particle p asses through the shock region without strong interactions . The second panel shows that th eyposition of the accelerated electron also oscillates , while the third one shows that zincreases rapidly after the reﬂection . The average value of velocity vzover the period from ωpet= 220 to 400 is vz/c≃0.6 , and the value of vzat maximum γisvz/c≃0.8 . The maximum γin the bottom panel is γ≃40 . By the Lorentz transformation of these data , we can ﬁnd vandBin the wave frame . At the time and position of maximum γ , they are v=c ( 0.27,0.13,0.95 ) and B= B0 ( 0.70,0.16,2.56 ) . This conﬁrms our statement in the previous section that v║is the dominant component in vthere ; i.e. , vz≃v║Bz/B . According to the theory , ( 47 ) , electron energies can be extr emely high at some angles and shock speeds . To examine this prediction , we have carrie d out several simulations with diﬀerent values of the propagation angle θ , keeping other parameters unchanged ; Lx= 4096∆ g , ωce/ωpe= 3.0 , and vsh≃2.1vA . Figure 11 shows the maximum value of γas a function of the propagation angle θ . Here the electron energy takes the highest value at the angle θ≃52◦ . For these simulation parameters , Eq . ( 47 ) predicts that γtakes a peak value atθ≃53◦ . Thus the theory and simulation are in good agreement . Furth er , we carried out simulations with diﬀerent values of the shock speed vsh ; the propagation angle is ﬁxed to be θ= 45◦ . Figure 12 shows the maximum value of γas a function of the shock speed vsh . The observed values have a peak at vsh/c≃0.7 . For these parameters , Eq . ( 47 ) predicts that γ takes large values for vsh/c≃0.71 . Again , the theory and simulation are in good agreement . VI . SUMMARY We have studied electron motion in a shock wave propagating o bliquely to a magnetic ﬁeld . First , we analytically discussed electron motion in a n oblique shock wave . It is pointed out that , if an electron is reﬂected near the end of a l arge-amplitude pulse , it would gain a great deal of energy from the electric ﬁeld formed in th e wave . The condition for the reﬂection is then examined . Further , the maximum energy of a reﬂected electron is 12 estimated , and its dependence on plasma parameters is discu ssed . Next , we investigated the shock evolution and associated electron acceleration by us ing a one-dimensional , relativistic , electromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion an d electron dynamics . It was shown that an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic elect rons ; Lorentz factors with γ > ∼100 have been observed . As the theory predicts , at certain propa gation angles electron energies become extremely high . The electron reﬂection and resultan t acceleration takes place when the wave amplitude is large and the magnetic ﬁeld is rather st rong , ωce > ∼ωpe . In the present paper , strong electron acceleration has been demonstrated . As future work , it would be desirable to develop further the quantitat ive theory for large-amplitude oblique waves . The evaluation of the electric ﬁeld strength along the magnetic ﬁeld will be especially important , which will enable us to estimate the m aximum energy more accurately . From the view point of nonlinear wave propagation , motion of trapped electrons and their eﬀects on the wave evolution are also quite interesting . APPENDIX A : RELATIONS AMONG QUANTITIES We here describe relations among the physical variables , us ing the approximation appro- priate for low-frequency magnetosonic waves with small amp litudes ( for the details of the calculations , see Ref . [ 29 ] ) . We assume quasi neutrality , n≃ni≃neand use the following stretched variables τ=ǫ3/2t , ( A1 ) ξ=ǫ1/2 ( x−vp0t ) , ( A2 ) ( vp0is the wave propagation speed in the long-wavelength limit i n a ﬁnite beta plasma ) and expansion n=n0+ǫn1+ǫ2n2+ ... , ( A3 ) Ey=ǫEy1+ǫ2Ey2+ ... , ( A4 ) Bz=Bz0+ǫBz1+ǫ2Bz2+ ... , ( A5 ) then , we can express the lowest order perturbations in terms ofn1as Bz1/B0=cEy1/ ( B0vp0 ) = [ ( v2 p0−c2 s ) /v2 Asinθ ] ( n1/n0 ) , ( A6 ) cEz1 B0=−vp0By1 B0= ( ωce−ωci ) ωceωci ( v2 p0−c2 s ) v2 p0 ( v2 p0−v2 Acos2θ ) cotθ n0∂n1 ∂ξ . ( A7 ) Herecsis the sound speed , c2 s= ( Γ epe0+Γipi0 ) / ( n0mi ) with Γ j ( j=eori ) the speciﬁc heat ratio and pj0the equilibrium pressure . We can obtain KdV equation by proc eeding to the next order , O ( ǫ5/2 ) . The relations ( A6 ) and ( A7 ) are valid , even when the wave proﬁ le is not soliton-like . That is , perturbations propagating in the same direction wi thvx∼vp0have the relations ( A6 ) and ( A7 ) . 13 APPENDIX B : MAGNITUDES OF E║AND F For a nonrelativistic , small-amplitude oblique magnetoso nic wave , the electric ﬁeld par- allel to the magnetic ﬁeld , E║ , has been analytically obtained [ 32 ] . However , for a large- amplitude wave , it will be quite diﬃcult to obtain E║in a rigorous manner . Here , on the basis of a simple physical picture , we will give a rough estim ate of the parallel electric ﬁeld E║in a relativistic , large-amplitude , oblique shock wave . Fu rther , by using it , we will obtain the maximum value of the quantity F. We consider in the wave frame . In the ﬂuid model , the equation of motion may be written as mjd ( γjvj ) dt=qjE+qjvj×B c. ( B1 ) Here the pressure term is neglected . The subscript jrefers to ions j=ior electrons j=e . The time derivative d /dtis deﬁned as d dt=∂ ∂t+vj· ∇ . ( B2 ) We denote by bthe unit vector along the magnetic ﬁeld . Then multiplying Eq . ( B1 ) by b , we have mjd ( γjb·vj ) dt−mjγjvj·db dt=qjE║ . ( B3 ) Lett1be the time when a ﬂuid element is at the leading edge of the sho ck ( the location where the shock proﬁle begins to sharply rise ) and t2be the time when it is at the point xm ; xmis the location where the electric potential and magnetic ﬁe ld take their maximum values . Then , integrating from t1tot2 , we ﬁnd for the ions mi ( γi2b2·vi2−γi1b1·vi1 ) −mi < γivi > · ( b2−b1 ) ≃eE║∆ | < vix > | . ( B4 ) Here the bracket indicates the mean value over the time perio d ( t2−t1 ) , and ∆ is the shock width . We have a relation ( t2−t1 ) ≃∆/| < vix > | . For oblique shocks , ∆ will be of the order of the ion inertial length , ∆ ≃c/ωpi . The velocity at time t1isvi1=−vshex , where exis the unit vector in the xdirection . The velocity vixwill be slowed down by the longitudinal electric ﬁeld . Thus vix2will be smaller in magnitude than vix1 . Because Bzis large at the point xmandBy ( xm ) ∼0 , the unit vector b2is nearly parallel to the z direction . Consequently , the inner product ( b2·vi2 ) will be quite small ; here we neglect the zcomponent of vi2 . Since the xcomponent of b1is given by Bx0/B0 , we have mi ( γi1vsh+ < γivix > ) Bx0/B0≃eE║∆/| < vix > | . ( B5 ) This gives the strength of the parallel electric ﬁeld as eE║≃miv2 sh ∆| < vix > | vsh ( γi1+ < γivix > vsh ) Bx0 B0 . ( B6 ) 14 Because |vix|is smaller than vsh , the range of | < vix > |is expected to be 1 /2 < ∼ | < vix > |/vsh < 1 , except maybe for extremely strong shock waves . In fact , if we assume a simple time dependence of vix vix=−vsh [ 1−a1 ( t−t1 ) / ( t2−t1 ) ] for t1≤t≤t2 , ( B7 ) witha1a constant ( 0 ≤a1≤1 ) , then , after integrating over time , we have < vix > =−vsh ( 1− a1/2 ) . The Lorentz factor for the ﬂuid ion will be close to unity . Acc ordingly , for instance , if the ion ﬂuid velocity vixis decreased to a value ∼ −vsh/2 , then the value of the content in the parentheses would be about 1/4 . The electron speed will be ∼vshwhen the electrons encounter the shock and will be close to the speed of light when they are at the point xm . If we assume that the electron velocity is nearly parallel to the ﬁeld line in the shock region , then ( v·db/dt ) can be neglected . Hence we have me ( −γe2c+γe1vshBx0/B0 ) ≃ −eE║ ( t2−t1 ) . ( B8 ) The second term on the left-hand side , γe1vshBx0/B0 , can be neglected compared with the ﬁrst term γe2c . The ions and electrons will have nearly the same time period ( t2−t1 ) to keep charge neutrality . Substituting Eq . ( B6 ) in ( B8 ) yield s γe2≃mivsh mec ( γi1+ < γivix > vsh ) Bx0 B0 . ( B9 ) Atx=xm , vzcan be estimated as vz≃ −cBz/B ( for reﬂected electrons the sign is reversed ) . For a large-amplitude shock , the ratio Bz/Bis an order-unity quantity there . The quantity hdeﬁned by Eq . ( 42 ) is obtained as h2≃mec2 [ 1 +vshBz0/ ( cBx0 ) ] . ( B10 ) If we average Eq . ( 43 ) over electrons in a small volume elemen t , we have < hγ > =e ( F−F0 ) +mec2 < γ0 > . ( B11 ) Here we used the relation < vz0 > = 0 . If electrons have the velocity vz≃ −cBz/Batx=xm , then we ﬁnd the maximum value of Ffrom Eq . ( 43 ) as e ( Fm−F0 ) ≃h2γe2−mec2 < γ0 > . ( B12 ) In many practical cases , we can take < γ0 > to be order unity . Roughly speaking , the quantity e ( Fm−F0 ) is of the order of micvsh . It is , therefore , much greater than electron thermal energy mev2 Te ( ∼µB ) and drift kinetic energy mev2 d ( ∼mev2 sh ) . 15 REFERENCES [ 1 ] S. R. Kane , K. Kai , T. Kosugi , S. Enome , P. B.
