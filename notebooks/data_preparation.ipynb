It is found that an oblique shock c an produce electrons with ultra-relativistic energies ; Lorentz fact ors with γ > ∼100 have been observed in our simulations . The physical mechanisms f or the reﬂection and acceleration are discussed , and the maximum energy is es timated . If the electron reﬂection occurs near the end of a large-amplit ude pulse , those particles will then be trapped in the pulse and gain a great de al of energy . The theory predicts that the electron energies can become es pecially high at certain propagation angles . This is veriﬁed by the simulati ons . 52.65.Cc , 52.35.Tc , 52.35.Mw , 98.70.Sa Typeset using REVT EX 1 I . INTRODUCTION Electron acceleration has been an important issue in plasma physics and astrophysics . In solar physics , for instance , the acceleration of electrons as well as of ions has received a great deal of attention ; in solar ﬂares , gamma rays with energies o f several tens of MeV , which are emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electro ns , are often observed [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . In astrophysics , much more energetic electrons have been disc ussed . From the observations of X-rays and gamma rays , it is now believed that electrons with energies up to ∼100 TeV are produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . It is also believed that in the Crab Nebula high-energy electrons accelerated up to ∼100 TeV are produced by the pulsar wind [ 5 ] . Theories based on the Fermi acceleration model hav e been proposed to account for these high-energy phenomena [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . As for laboratory pla smas , in an attempt to realize plasma-based accelerators , the electron acceleration in a relativistic space charge wave has been intensively studied by simulations and experiments [ 8 ] . Ion acceleration in a magnetosonic wave has been studied by m any authors [ 9 ] - [ 22 ] . In a single-ion-species plasma , the large positive potenti al formed in the shock region can reﬂect some ions and give great energies to them [ 9 ] - [ 18 ] . In a multi-ion-species plasma such as space plasmas , some of the majority ions ( hydrogen ) c an also gain energies by the same mechanism . Furthermore , the transverse electric ﬁ eld in the shock wave can accelerate all particles of all kinds of ( minority ) heavy io ns to nearly the same speed [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] . In addition , in a turbulent plasma where particles can interact with many diﬀerent large-amplitude magnetosonic pulses , some energetic ions can be further accelerated by a diﬀerent mechanism [ 21 ] . These processes have been extens ively studied by theory and particle simulation by many authors and have been applied to the production of high-energy particles in solar ﬂares and interplanetary shocks [ 9 ] - [ 20 ] . Strong electron acceleration in shock waves , however , has n ot been shown by particle simulations . In this paper we will theoretically and numeri cally study electron motion in a magnetosonic shock wave propagating obliquely to a magnet ic ﬁeld . We will show that an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic electrons . The preliminary result has been reported in Ref . [ 23 ] . In Sec . II , we outline some basic properties of oblique shock s. In Sec . III , we theoretically discuss the possibility of electron reﬂection . If electron s are reﬂected near the end of the main pulse , then after the reﬂection they can have great ener gies in the main pulse . Several authors discussed stationary pulse solutions for t he nonlinear magnetosonic waves [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] . However , if the magnetic ﬁeld is rather strong so thatωce/ωpe > ∼1 , where ωce is the electron cyclotron frequency and ωpeis the plasma frequency , or if the amplitude is quite large , then the pulse propagation is not perfectly sta tionary [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ; small-amplitude ﬂuctuations are generated in and around the main pulse . Even though the potential is positive in the main pulse in a shock wave , the electron reﬂec tion studied in this paper can occur in such a non-stationary pulse . In Sec . IV , we estimate the maximum energy of a reﬂected elect ron and discuss its dependence on plasma parameters . In Sec . V , we further study the electron acceleration by using a one-dimensional ( one space coordinate and three vel ocity components ) , relativistic , electromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion an d electron dynamics . It will be shown that some electrons can be reﬂected near the end of the m ain pulse and are trapped 2 in the shock region . In the simulations , an appreciable numb er of electrons have energies γ > 100 , where γis the Lorentz factor . Further , we will examine the dependen ce ofγon the propagation angle and shock speed . It is veriﬁed that , as the theory predicts , there are special angles and shock speeds at which the electron acceleration i s especially strong . Our work is summarized in Sec . VI . In Appendix A , we describe relations a mong physical quantities in a magnetosonic wave . In Appendix B , we give a rough estimate fo r the magnitude of parallel electric ﬁeld E║on the basis of a simple physical picture . II . VELOCITIES AND FIELDS IN AN OBLIQUE WAVE We consider a magnetosonic wave propagating in the xdirection with a speed vshin an external magnetic ﬁeld in the ( x , z ) plane . We assume that the ﬁeld quantities depend onxonly ; ∂/∂y =∂/∂z = 0 . Then , from the equation ∇ ·B= 0 , it follows that the xcomponent of the magnetic ﬁeld is constant , Bx=Bx0 . The other components Byand Bzare functions of x , and in the pulse region Byas well as Bzcan have ﬁnite values . In the wave frame where the time derivatives are zero ( ∂/∂t= 0 ) , the electric ﬁeld in the y direction is constant , Ey=Ey0 , and Ezis zero . Hence we have B= ( Bx0 , By , Bz ) and E= ( Ex , Ey0,0 ) . In Sections II-IV , theoretical analyses will be made mai nly in the wave frame . The velocity of the guiding-center position of an electron , vg , may be written as vg= ( B/B ) v║+vd , ( 1 ) withvdbeing the drift velocity vd=cE×B/B2− ( cµ/e ) ( B× ∇B ) /B2 . ( 2 ) Herecis the speed of light , −eis the electron charge ( e > 0 ) , v║is the velocity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld , and µis the magnetic moment µ=mev2 ⊥/ ( 2B ) , ( 3 ) withmethe electron mass and v⊥the gyration speed perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld . In the far upstream region , we have no ∇B-drift . Also , the zcomponent of the velocity averaged over all the electrons in a small volume element mus t be zero , < vgz0 > = 0 ; the subscript 0 refers to the quantities in the far upstream regi on . Accordingly , from the z component of Eq . ( 1 ) we have the average parallel velocity < v║0 > =cEy0 B0Bx0 Bz0 , ( 4 ) in the wave frame ( see Fig . 1 ) . Also , because < vgx0 > =−vsh , thexcomponent of Eq . ( 1 ) gives vsh=−Bx0 B0 < v║0 > −cEy0Bz0 B2 0 . ( 5 ) ThusEy0is related to the shock speed vshthrough 3 Ey0=−vshBz0/c . ( 6 ) For the deﬁniteness , we assume that Bx0 , Bz0andvshare all positive ; and thus Ey0 < 0 . The nonlinear wave theory tells us the wave structure . A shoc k wave will have a positive electric potential ϕ ( x ) . The quantities ϕ , Bz , ni , and nehave similar proﬁles [ 28 ] - [ 29 ] ( see Appendix A ) ; here ni , and neare the ion and electron densities , respectively . On the oth er hand , ExandByare proportional to the xderivatives of these quantities ; for instance , Ex=−∂ϕ/∂x . These relations among the quantities are obtained for smal l-amplitude waves . In the following theoretical analysis , we assume tha t the relations are also valid for large-amplitude waves . As we will see later in Fig . 7 , simula tion results also support this assumption . We denote by xmthexposition at which the potential takes its maximum value ; hen ce , Ex ( xm ) ≃0 and By ( xm ) ≃0 . For later use , we also note that the quantity Bz/Btakes its maximum value at x=xm ; that is , if Bz ( x ) is smaller than Bz ( xm ) , then Bz ( xm ) 2 B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2 > Bz ( x ) 2 B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2 . ( 7 ) This can be proved by the following equation Bz ( xm ) 2 B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2= [ Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 ] B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2By ( x ) 2 [ B2 x0+Bz ( xm ) 2 ] [ B2 x0+By ( x ) 2+Bz ( x ) 2 ] . ( 8 ) Because Bz ( xm ) is the maximum value of Bz ( x ) , the term [ Bz ( xm ) 2−Bz ( x ) 2 ] B2 x0is positive . Hence the right-hand side of the above equation is positive . We know the stationary , ﬁnite-amplitude solutions for perp endicular waves [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] . The stationary solitary wave solution is valid when the magneti c ﬁeld is weak , ωce/ωpe < < 1 , and when the wave amplitude is not large , 1 < M < 2 , where Mis the Alfv´ en Mach number ; M=vsh/vAwithvAthe Alfv´ en speed , v2 A=B2 0/ ( 4πnimi ) . Simulations and experiments show that large-amplitude pulses can propagate nearly stea dily , even when the amplitudes are large or the magnetic ﬁelds are strong . Oblique pulses ca n also propagate nearly steadily . As the magnetic ﬁeld becomes stronger or the wave amplitude i s increased , non-stationary eﬀects will become important [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . III . ELECTRON REFLECTION Because the potential is usually positive in the shock regio n , some of the ions can be reﬂected when they go up the potential . As we will see later , e lectrons can also be reﬂected ; its mechanism is , however , diﬀerent from that of ion reﬂecti on . We give a physical picture of the electron reﬂection . From the nonrelativistic equation of motion for an electron medv dt=−e ( E+v×B c ) , ( 9 ) we have an equation for the kinetic energy in the wave frame 4 me ( v2−v2 0 ) /2 =e ( ϕ−ϕ0 ) −eEy0∫ vydt . ( 10 ) Here we have used the relation Ez= 0 . The velocity vincludes gyro , parallel , and drift motions . We deﬁne length sas ds= ( B/B x0 ) vgxdt , ( 11 ) where vgxis the xcomponent of the electron velocity vgx= ( Bx0/B ) v║+vdx , ( 12 ) ( see Fig . 2 ) . Thus d s/dtis given by ds dt=v║+B Bx0vdx . ( 13 ) We can interpret d sas an inﬁnitesimal length along the ﬁeld line corresponding to the length dx=vgxdt ; ds= ( B/B x0 ) dx . In general the guiding-center velocity vgis not parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B . Hence the guiding center does not move along the ﬁeld line . F or a stationary , one-dimensional problem ( ∂/∂t= 0 and ∂/∂y=∂/∂z= 0 ) , all quantities depend only on x . As a result , for any stationary function f ( x ) we have ∫x2 x1f ( x ) ( B/B x0 ) dx=∫s2 s1f ( s ) ds , ( 14 ) where s1ands2are the positions along the same ﬁeld line ; their xpositions are x1andx2 , respectively . If we deﬁne quantity Fas E║=−dF/ds , ( 15 ) then with the aid of ( 11 ) and the relation E║=E·B/B , we have F=−∫ ( ExBx0+Ey0By ) BB Bx0dx , ( 16 ) which can be written as F=−∫/parenleftbigg Ex−vshBz0By cBx0/parenrightbigg dx . ( 17 ) Using the electric potential ϕand the vector potential A ( B=∇ ×A ) , we ﬁnd F=ϕ− ( vsh/c ) ( Bz0/Bx0 ) Az , ( 18 ) where Azis the zcomponent of the vector potential , Az=−∫ Bydx . ( 19 ) 5 The quantities ϕandBzhave similar proﬁles , while Byis proportional to ∂Bz/∂x [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . Hence AzandFhave proﬁles similar to ϕ . If we deﬁne quantity Flin the laboratory frame ( the subscript ldenotes the laboratory frame ) as Fl=−∫ El║ ( Bl/Blx0 ) dxl , ( 20 ) then for a stationary , one-dimensional problem , that is , fo r a case where wave proﬁles can be written as f ( xl , tl ) =f ( xl−vshtl ) , we ﬁnd Fl=−∫/parenleftbigg Elx−vshBlz0Bly cBlx0/parenrightbigg dxl . ( 21 ) One can readily show that it is related to Fin the wave frame as F=γshFl , ( 22 ) where γshis deﬁned as γsh= ( 1−v2 sh/c2 ) −1/2 . ( 23 ) In Appendix B , we give a rough estimate of the maximum value of F , Eq . ( B9 ) , found from qualitative physical considerations . Combining Eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 18 ) , we eliminate ϕ mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) − ( eEy0/Bx0 ) ( Az−Az0+∫ vyBx0dt ) . ( 24 ) By virtue of the deﬁnition of Az , ( 19 ) , and the relation d x=vxdt , this equation can be written as mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) +e ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ∫ ( vxBy−vyBx0 ) dt . ( 25 ) Then , using the zcomponent of the equation of motion , we ﬁnd mev2/2−mev2 0/2 =e ( F−F0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( vz−vz0 ) . ( 26 ) In the drift approximation , the kinetic energy can be expres sed as mev2/2 =me ( v2 ║+v2 d ) /2 +µB . ( 27 ) Hence , averaging Eq . ( 26 ) over the electron cyclotron perio d , we have ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║+v2 d ) +µB+mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) vgz−eF = ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║0+v2 d0 ) +µB0+mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) vz0−eF0 . ( 28 ) With the aid of the zcomponent of Eq . ( 1 ) , we can eliminate vgzand obtain the following equation 6 ( me/2 ) ( v║−vrv ) 2+K=e ( F−F0 ) −µ ( B−B0 ) + ( me/2 ) ( v2 ║0+v2 d0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( vdz−vz0 ) − ( me/2 ) v2 d , ( 29 ) where vrvandKare deﬁned as vrv=−cEy0Bz/ ( Bx0B ) ( > 0 ) , ( 30 ) K=−mev2 rv/2 ( < 0 ) . ( 31 ) If we eliminate Ey0by substituting Eq . ( 6 ) in Eq . ( 30 ) , vrvcan be expressed as vrv=vshBz0Bz/ ( Bx0B ) . ( 32 ) We will see below that the velocity vgxis reversed when v║=vrv . In the pulse region , the quantity e ( F−F0 ) can be much larger in magnitude than the other terms on the ri ght-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) ( see Appendix B ) . We denote the left-hand sid e of Eq . ( 29 ) by Ee , i.e. , Ee= ( me/2 ) ( v║−vrv ) 2+K . As shown in Fig . 3 , at a ﬁxed point x , Eehas its minimum value Kwhen v║=vrv . It is negative in the region 0 < v║ < 2vrv . ( 33 ) Because vdx=cEy0Bz/B2 , it follows from Eq . ( 12 ) that vgx= 0 if v║=vrv . As can be seen from Eq . ( 4 ) , most of the electrons have negative parall el velocities in the far upstream region . Accordingly , we suppose that the initial parallel v elocity is negative , v║ < 0 . If v║gradually increases and exceeds vrvat a certain position , then the xcomponent of the guiding center velocity , vgx , changes from negative to positive values there , i.e. , it is reversed . As an electron moves , i.e. , as xchanges , the quantities K , F , B , etc . also vary . At any point x , Kis the minimum value of the left-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) . If ther e is a region where the values of the right-hand side of Eq . ( 29 ) become smaller t hanK , then the electron can not enter there ; it will be reﬂected . We recall that ϕ , F , and Bzhave similar proﬁles and that at x=xmthe quantity ( Bz/B ) has a maximum value [ see Eq . ( 7 ) ] . Because Kis proportional to ( Bz/B ) 2 , it will be quite small ( |K|is large ) around the point x=xm , and Fis large . In front of or behind the main pulse , Fis relatively small and Kis relatively large ; e ( F−F0 ) could be smaller than K. Thus , if the electron reﬂection occurs , it will be in such regions . In quasi-perpendicular shocks , where ( Bz0/Bx0 ) > > 1 , vrvis large . Hence Khas large negative values . Thus the electron reﬂection in this mechan ism will be diﬃcult . Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of the trajectory of guidi ng center . Here it is assumed that the reﬂection takes place at point D ; the dotted line sho ws the orbit of a passing electron . As an electron moves from point A to C , it moves to the negative ydirection because of the Ex×Bzdrift . It gains kinetic energy ∆ E1from the electric potential ∆E1=eϕ ( xC ) −eϕ ( xA ) ( > 0 ) . ( 34 ) At the same time , it loses energy ∆ E2because of the electric ﬁeld Ey0 ∆E2=−eEy0 ( yC−yA ) ( < 0 ) . ( 35 ) 7 The net change in the energy is therefore ∆E= ∆E1+ ∆E2 . ( 36 ) Even though the magnitudes of ∆ E1and ∆ E2are quite large , they almost cancel when an electron moves with drift approximation ; in particular , in a perpendicular pulse they have exactly the same magnitude and ∆ E= 0 [ 30 ] . However , if an electron is reﬂected and moves from D to E , then it would gain energies from both ExandEy0 . As a result , the increase in energy is ∆E= ∆E1+ ∆E3 , ( 37 ) where ∆ E3is deﬁned as ∆E3=−eEy0 ( yE−yA ) ( > 0 ) . ( 38 ) IV . ESTIMATE OF ENERGY INCREASE Next , we will obtain the maximum energy of a reﬂected electro n. Because it can have quite high energy , we will use the relativistic equation of m otion med ( γv ) dt=−e ( E+v×B c ) , ( 39 ) where γis the Lorentz factor . For the stationary , one-dimensional system being considered , this can be integrated to give the energy conservation equat ion meγc2−meγ0c2=e ( ϕ−ϕ0 ) −eEy0∫ vydt . ( 40 ) This is a relativistic form of Eq . ( 10 ) . Again , using the quan titiesF , Az , and the equation of motion , we can rewrite Eq . ( 40 ) as meγc2−meγ0c2=e ( F−F0 ) −mec ( Ey0/Bx0 ) ( γvz−γ0vz0 ) . ( 41 ) If we deﬁne quantity has h=mec2−mevshBz0vz/Bx0 , ( 42 ) then from Eq . ( 41 ) we have γ= [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] /h . ( 43 ) Equation ( 42 ) indicates that his positive if Bz0/Bx0is of order unity . If Bz0/Bx0is much greater than unity , then hcan be negative . In addition , Eq . ( 43 ) shows that , if the init ial value of his positive , h0 > 0 , then his always positive in the region where ( F−F0 ) is positive . 8 We show in Fig . 5 schematic diagram of the function [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] . We suppose thatFhas a maximum value at x=xmand has a minimum value right behind the main pulse . If the reﬂection occurs , it would be in this dip , as sug gested in the previous section . The reﬂection point will be denoted by xr . In the top panel this function e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0is always positive . In the second one it becomes negative right behind the main pulse ; however its maximum value is positive ( h0can be either positive or negative ) . In the bottom one it is always negative . For the present acceleration mechani sm , the top panel is the most important ; the strong acceleration takes place in this case . Such dips would not be present in the perfectly stationary so lutions [ 24 ] - [ 29 ] . In large- amplitude magnetosonic waves , however , non-stationary di ps can be generated [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . We here just assume that there is a dip behind the main pulse an d discuss its eﬀects on particle orbits . First we consider the top panel in Fig . 5 : An electron with pos itiveh0is reﬂected at a certain point near the end of the main pulse . We will show that , after the reﬂection , hhas its minimum ( positive ) value at x=xm ; hence γhas its maximum value there . As mentioned earlier , the parallel velocity v║is already positive when an electron is reﬂected , i.e. , when vgxis reversed , even if its initial value is negative . After the reﬂection , v║will be increased by the ( positive ) parallel electric force . Because E║changes its sign at x=xm , v║will have a maximum value at x=xm ( unless vxchanges to negative values again before reaching the point xm ) . The parallel velocity will become the dominant component in the electron velocity , v∼v║B/B . The quantity Bz/Bas well as ϕandBzhas a maximum value at this point . Thus vz , which can be approximated as vz∼v║Bz/B , will also have the maximum value there . Because h0and ( Fm−F0 ) are both positive , his positive at x=xm . In addition , Eq . ( 42 ) indicates that hdecreases ( draws closer to zero ) as vzincreases . Hence , hof a reﬂected electron will have a minimum positive value at x=xm . Its energy γwill therefore have a maximum value there . If hcan be close to zero , then γwould become quite large . IfBx0is small and vz0has a large positive value , then h0becomes small ( can be even negative ) . We now consider such particles ; the second panel in Fig . 5 . Also in this case , vzwill have larger values after the reﬂection ; thus hwill decrease . At the reﬂection point in the dip , the quantity [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] is negative . Consequently , h ( xr ) < 0 . If the reﬂection occurs , the electron would move in the positive xdirection . Because vzincreases , hwill further decrease . Hence , the particle would never be ab le to penetrate the region again where hγ > 0 . The strong acceleration in this mechanism , therefore , wi ll not take place . Next , we consider a case where the quantity [ e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0 ] is always negative ( the bottom panel in Fig . 5 ) . Then , his always negative . If the reﬂection occurs at x=xr , then|h|would increase while |e ( F−F0 ) +h0γ0|would decrease . Hence , even if the particle reaches the point xm , γwould not have an extremely large value . Therefore , the stro ng acceleration is not expected . We can estimate the maximum value γmin the wave frame by substituting the maximum value of F , Eq . ( B12 ) , in Eq . ( 43 ) . The maximum γin the laboratory frame can be obtained by the Lorentz transformation as γlm=γsh ( 1 +vxvsh/c2 ) γm≃γshγm . ( 44 ) 9 Now let us consider a case where hbecomes quite small , h≃0 , atx=xm . There the electron speed would be close to the speed of light c. Hence , roughly , we have vz∼cBz/B . The quantity hcan then be expressed as h=mec2/parenleftbigg 1−γshvsh cBz Btanθ/parenrightbigg , ( 45 ) where tan θ=Blz0/Blx0 . Here we have used the relations Bz0=γshBlz0andBx0=Blx0 . Because Bzbecomes quite large in the shock region , we may put as Bz/B∼1 . Equation ( 45 ) then suggests that the electron energy can become extre mely large when γsh ( vsh/c ) tanθ= 1 , ( 46 ) or , equivalently ccosθ=vsh . ( 47 ) V. SIMULATION STUDIES A. Simulation Method We further study the electron acceleration by using a one-di mensional ( one space co- ordinate and three velocity components ) , relativistic , el ectromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion and electron dynamics [ 31 ] . The total syst em length is Lx= 4096∆ g for most of the simulation runs , where ∆ gis the grid spacing . All lengths and velocities in the simulations were normalized to ∆ gandωpe∆g , respectively , where ωpeis the spatially averaged plasma frequency . We use a bounded plasma model . The plasma is limited to the reg ion 400 < x < 3696 . The particles are specularly reﬂected at x= 400 and at x= 3696 . The radiation leaving the plasma region is absorbed in the vacuum regions , 0 < x < 400 and 3696 < x < 4096 . Thus the electromagnetic interactions between the two plasma bo undaries through the vacuum regions are made negligibly small [ 12 ] . In most of the plasma region , i.e. , in 500 < x < 3696 , each particle species initially has a uniform density and has a Maxwellian velocity distributio n function . In the small region , 400 < x < 480 , the plasma density is four times as high as that in the mai n region . That is , the initial plasma density can be written as ne= 4n0for 400 < x < x 1 , ne= 4n0exp [ − ( x−x1 ) 2/ ( 2d2 ) ] for x1 < x < 500 , ne=n0for 500 < x < 3696 . Herex1= 480 and d= 12 . In the high-density region , 400 < x < 480 , particles have shifted Maxwellian velocity distribution functions with a verage velocity vps ; fj∼exp [ − ( v− vps ) 2/ ( 2v2 Tj ) ] , where the subscript jrefers to particle species . These particles act as a piston . They push the neighboring particles and excite a sho ck wave . We can change the 10 shock strength by changing the magnitude of vps ; the velocity vpsis perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld so that no particles have extremely l arge parallel speeds initially . More detailed description about the simulation code can be f ound in Ref . [ 12 ] . The simulation parameters are as follows . The number of simu lation particles is Ni= Ne= 262 ,144 . The ion-to-electron mass ratio is mi/me= 100 . The ratio ωce/ωpeis ωce/ωpe= 3.0 in the far upstream region . The electron and ion thermal vel ocities are vTe/c= 0.38 and vTi/c= 0.01 , respectively . The Alfv´ en speed is vA/c= 0.3 . The electron skin depth is c/ωpe= 4∆ g. The time step is suﬃciently small , ωpe∆t= 0.02 , so that ∆ tis much smaller than the plasma and cyclotron periods even in th e shock region . As in the theoretical model , the external magnetic ﬁeld is in the ( x , z ) plane , and waves propagate in the xdirection . B. Simulation Results First , we study a shock with the propagation angle θ= 45◦ ; i.e. , Bx0=Bz0 . Figure 6 shows proﬁles of Bzin the shock wave at various times . Here , the magnetic ﬁeld is normalized toBz0 . The Mach number is observed to be M= 2.3 , i.e. , the shock speed is vsh= 2.3vA . The maximum value of Bzis 4∼5 times as large as Bz0 . The main pulse propagates nearly steadily . However , the proﬁle is not perfectly stationary . Figure 7 displays ﬁeld proﬁles at ωpet= 680 ; here the magnetic and electric ﬁelds are both normalized to B0 . As the theory predicts [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , EyandBzhave similar proﬁles , while Ex , Ez , andByare quite small in magnitude at the point where Bzhas its maximum value . Figure 8 shows phase space plots of electrons at ωpet= 680 . In the shock region , ultra-relativistic electrons are produced . The maximum va lue of Lorentz factors is γ≃130 . We also see that pxandpzhave greater values than py , which is consistent with the picture that the parallel velocity is dominant in the motion of high- energy electrons . From Figs . 7 and 8 , we see that some electrons are reﬂected near the end of t he main pulse and that the high-energy electrons are present in the shock region . Figure 9 shows proﬁles of E║ , F , and the electric potential ϕatωpet= 650 and at ωpet= 680 . The quantities ˜Fand ˜ϕdenote eF/ ( mec2 ) and eϕ/ ( mec2 ) , respectively . The quantities Fandϕwere obtained in the simulation by the following equations F ( x ) =−∫x E║ ( B/B x0 ) dx , ( 48 ) ϕ ( x ) =−∫x Exdx . ( 49 ) As mentioned earlier , roughly speaking , the parallel elect ric ﬁeld E║is positive in the region where ∂Bz/∂xand∂F/∂x are negative . It is negative in the region where they are posi tive . Comparing the plots at diﬀerent times , we see that the wave pr oﬁles are not perfectly stationary . They vary with time with small-amplitudes . In p articular , as shown in the plot atωpet= 680 , Fsometimes becomes negative near the end of the main pulse , wh ere the electron reﬂection can take place . Next , we will study trajectories of electrons ; we will ﬁnd th at it is the reﬂected electrons that gain great energies . Figure 10 displays time variation s of ( x−vsht ) , y , z , and γof 11 electrons in a shock with vsh= 1.75vA ; ( x−vsht ) is the xposition in the wave frame . The lengths are normalized to the electron skin depth c/ωpe . ( Here the system size is a half of that in the previous run ; the other parameters such as Ne/Lxare the same . ) Two typical examples are presented here . The thick lines show an electro n that was accelerated , and the thin lines represent an electron that was not accelerate d ; even the low-energy electron here has energy γ≃10 in the shock region and γ≃5 behind the shock . In all of the four panels , the low- and high-energy electrons both have small- amplitude , cyclotron oscillations with short periods , ωpet < ∼20 ; note that the cyclotron period depends on γas well as the ﬁeld strength B . At the same time , the accelerated electron has a large-ampl itude , long- period oscillation with period ωpet≃170 ; it begins when the particle enters the shock , ωpet= 180 , and continues until the end of this simulation run . ( Si mulations show that this period increases with γ . To observe this oscillation as many times as possible , we ha ve chosen here the case where γis not so large . ) For comparison with Fig . 4 , we show the times corresponding to points B , C , D , and E. From the long-pe riod oscillation of ( x−vsht ) in the top panel , we see that the electron that will become hig h energy is reﬂected and then trapped by the shock wave . On the other hand , the quantity ( x−vsht ) of the low-energy electron keeps decreasing , which means that this particle p asses through the shock region without strong interactions . The second panel shows that th eyposition of the accelerated electron also oscillates , while the third one shows that zincreases rapidly after the reﬂection . The average value of velocity vzover the period from ωpet= 220 to 400 is vz/c≃0.6 , and the value of vzat maximum γisvz/c≃0.8 . The maximum γin the bottom panel is γ≃40 . By the Lorentz transformation of these data , we can ﬁnd vandBin the wave frame . At the time and position of maximum γ , they are v=c ( 0.27,0.13,0.95 ) and B= B0 ( 0.70,0.16,2.56 ) . This conﬁrms our statement in the previous section that v║is the dominant component in vthere ; i.e. , vz≃v║Bz/B . According to the theory , ( 47 ) , electron energies can be extr emely high at some angles and shock speeds . To examine this prediction , we have carrie d out several simulations with diﬀerent values of the propagation angle θ , keeping other parameters unchanged ; Lx= 4096∆ g , ωce/ωpe= 3.0 , and vsh≃2.1vA . Figure 11 shows the maximum value of γas a function of the propagation angle θ . Here the electron energy takes the highest value at the angle θ≃52◦ . For these simulation parameters , Eq . ( 47 ) predicts that γtakes a peak value atθ≃53◦ . Thus the theory and simulation are in good agreement . Furth er , we carried out simulations with diﬀerent values of the shock speed vsh ; the propagation angle is ﬁxed to be θ= 45◦ . Figure 12 shows the maximum value of γas a function of the shock speed vsh . The observed values have a peak at vsh/c≃0.7 . For these parameters , Eq . ( 47 ) predicts that γ takes large values for vsh/c≃0.71 . Again , the theory and simulation are in good agreement . VI . SUMMARY We have studied electron motion in a shock wave propagating o bliquely to a magnetic ﬁeld . First , we analytically discussed electron motion in a n oblique shock wave . It is pointed out that , if an electron is reﬂected near the end of a l arge-amplitude pulse , it would gain a great deal of energy from the electric ﬁeld formed in th e wave . The condition for the reﬂection is then examined . Further , the maximum energy of a reﬂected electron is 12 estimated , and its dependence on plasma parameters is discu ssed . Next , we investigated the shock evolution and associated electron acceleration by us ing a one-dimensional , relativistic , electromagnetic , particle simulation code with full ion an d electron dynamics . It was shown that an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic elect rons ; Lorentz factors with γ > ∼100 have been observed . As the theory predicts , at certain propa gation angles electron energies become extremely high . The electron reﬂection and resultan t acceleration takes place when the wave amplitude is large and the magnetic ﬁeld is rather st rong , ωce > ∼ωpe . In the present paper , strong electron acceleration has been demonstrated . As future work , it would be desirable to develop further the quantitat ive theory for large-amplitude oblique waves . The evaluation of the electric ﬁeld strength along the magnetic ﬁeld will be especially important , which will enable us to estimate the m aximum energy more accurately . From the view point of nonlinear wave propagation , motion of trapped electrons and their eﬀects on the wave evolution are also quite interesting . APPENDIX A : RELATIONS AMONG QUANTITIES We here describe relations among the physical variables , us ing the approximation appro- priate for low-frequency magnetosonic waves with small amp litudes ( for the details of the calculations , see Ref . [ 29 ] ) . We assume quasi neutrality , n≃ni≃neand use the following stretched variables τ=ǫ3/2t , ( A1 ) ξ=ǫ1/2 ( x−vp0t ) , ( A2 ) ( vp0is the wave propagation speed in the long-wavelength limit i n a ﬁnite beta plasma ) and expansion n=n0+ǫn1+ǫ2n2+ ... , ( A3 ) Ey=ǫEy1+ǫ2Ey2+ ... , ( A4 ) Bz=Bz0+ǫBz1+ǫ2Bz2+ ... , ( A5 ) then , we can express the lowest order perturbations in terms ofn1as Bz1/B0=cEy1/ ( B0vp0 ) = [ ( v2 p0−c2 s ) /v2 Asinθ ] ( n1/n0 ) , ( A6 ) cEz1 B0=−vp0By1 B0= ( ωce−ωci ) ωceωci ( v2 p0−c2 s ) v2 p0 ( v2 p0−v2 Acos2θ ) cotθ n0∂n1 ∂ξ . ( A7 ) Herecsis the sound speed , c2 s= ( Γ epe0+Γipi0 ) / ( n0mi ) with Γ j ( j=eori ) the speciﬁc heat ratio and pj0the equilibrium pressure . We can obtain KdV equation by proc eeding to the next order , O ( ǫ5/2 ) . The relations ( A6 ) and ( A7 ) are valid , even when the wave proﬁ le is not soliton-like . That is , perturbations propagating in the same direction wi thvx∼vp0have the relations ( A6 ) and ( A7 ) . 13 APPENDIX B : MAGNITUDES OF E║AND F For a nonrelativistic , small-amplitude oblique magnetoso nic wave , the electric ﬁeld par- allel to the magnetic ﬁeld , E║ , has been analytically obtained [ 32 ] . However , for a large- amplitude wave , it will be quite diﬃcult to obtain E║in a rigorous manner . Here , on the basis of a simple physical picture , we will give a rough estim ate of the parallel electric ﬁeld E║in a relativistic , large-amplitude , oblique shock wave . Fu rther , by using it , we will obtain the maximum value of the quantity F. We consider in the wave frame . In the ﬂuid model , the equation of motion may be written as mjd ( γjvj ) dt=qjE+qjvj×B c. ( B1 ) Here the pressure term is neglected . The subscript jrefers to ions j=ior electrons j=e . The time derivative d /dtis deﬁned as d dt=∂ ∂t+vj· ∇ . ( B2 ) We denote by bthe unit vector along the magnetic ﬁeld . Then multiplying Eq . ( B1 ) by b , we have mjd ( γjb·vj ) dt−mjγjvj·db dt=qjE║ . ( B3 ) Lett1be the time when a ﬂuid element is at the leading edge of the sho ck ( the location where the shock proﬁle begins to sharply rise ) and t2be the time when it is at the point xm ; xmis the location where the electric potential and magnetic ﬁe ld take their maximum values . Then , integrating from t1tot2 , we ﬁnd for the ions mi ( γi2b2·vi2−γi1b1·vi1 ) −mi < γivi > · ( b2−b1 ) ≃eE║∆ | < vix > | . ( B4 ) Here the bracket indicates the mean value over the time perio d ( t2−t1 ) , and ∆ is the shock width . We have a relation ( t2−t1 ) ≃∆/| < vix > | . For oblique shocks , ∆ will be of the order of the ion inertial length , ∆ ≃c/ωpi . The velocity at time t1isvi1=−vshex , where exis the unit vector in the xdirection . The velocity vixwill be slowed down by the longitudinal electric ﬁeld . Thus vix2will be smaller in magnitude than vix1 . Because Bzis large at the point xmandBy ( xm ) ∼0 , the unit vector b2is nearly parallel to the z direction . Consequently , the inner product ( b2·vi2 ) will be quite small ; here we neglect the zcomponent of vi2 . Since the xcomponent of b1is given by Bx0/B0 , we have mi ( γi1vsh+ < γivix > ) Bx0/B0≃eE║∆/| < vix > | . ( B5 ) This gives the strength of the parallel electric ﬁeld as eE║≃miv2 sh ∆| < vix > | vsh ( γi1+ < γivix > vsh ) Bx0 B0 . ( B6 ) 14 Because |vix|is smaller than vsh , the range of | < vix > |is expected to be 1 /2 < ∼ | < vix > |/vsh < 1 , except maybe for extremely strong shock waves . In fact , if we assume a simple time dependence of vix vix=−vsh [ 1−a1 ( t−t1 ) / ( t2−t1 ) ] for t1≤t≤t2 , ( B7 ) witha1a constant ( 0 ≤a1≤1 ) , then , after integrating over time , we have < vix > =−vsh ( 1− a1/2 ) . The Lorentz factor for the ﬂuid ion will be close to unity . Acc ordingly , for instance , if the ion ﬂuid velocity vixis decreased to a value ∼ −vsh/2 , then the value of the content in the parentheses would be about 1/4 . The electron speed will be ∼vshwhen the electrons encounter the shock and will be close to the speed of light when they are at the point xm . If we assume that the electron velocity is nearly parallel to the ﬁeld line in the shock region , then ( v·db/dt ) can be neglected . Hence we have me ( −γe2c+γe1vshBx0/B0 ) ≃ −eE║ ( t2−t1 ) . ( B8 ) The second term on the left-hand side , γe1vshBx0/B0 , can be neglected compared with the ﬁrst term γe2c . The ions and electrons will have nearly the same time period ( t2−t1 ) to keep charge neutrality . Substituting Eq . ( B6 ) in ( B8 ) yield s γe2≃mivsh mec ( γi1+ < γivix > vsh ) Bx0 B0 . ( B9 ) Atx=xm , vzcan be estimated as vz≃ −cBz/B ( for reﬂected electrons the sign is reversed ) . For a large-amplitude shock , the ratio Bz/Bis an order-unity quantity there . The quantity hdeﬁned by Eq . ( 42 ) is obtained as h2≃mec2 [ 1 +vshBz0/ ( cBx0 ) ] . ( B10 ) If we average Eq . ( 43 ) over electrons in a small volume elemen t , we have < hγ > =e ( F−F0 ) +mec2 < γ0 > . ( B11 ) Here we used the relation < vz0 > = 0 . If electrons have the velocity vz≃ −cBz/Batx=xm , then we ﬁnd the maximum value of Ffrom Eq . ( 43 ) as e ( Fm−F0 ) ≃h2γe2−mec2 < γ0 > . ( B12 ) In many practical cases , we can take < γ0 > to be order unity . Roughly speaking , the quantity e ( Fm−F0 ) is of the order of micvsh . It is , therefore , much greater than electron thermal energy mev2 Te ( ∼µB ) and drift kinetic energy mev2 d ( ∼mev2 sh ) . 15 REFERENCES [ 1 ] S. R. Kane , K. Kai , T. Kosugi , S. Enome , P. B.
