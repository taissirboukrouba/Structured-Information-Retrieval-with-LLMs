      "Using the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at position x contained in waves with wavevector k, we describe surface wave transport over static ﬂows consisting of two length scales; one varying smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale com- parable to the wavelength.\n",
      "The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface ﬂows augment the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions of the cor- relations of the random surface currents.\n",
      "These scattering terms depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism.\n",
      "The Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modiﬁes the scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths with short wavelengths.\n",
      "Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying ﬂow.\n",
      "At yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an equation for wave energy diﬀusion.\n",
      "The associated diﬀusion constant is also expressed in terms of the surface ﬂow correlations.\n",
      "Our results provide a formal set of equations to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity, energy, and wave scattering as a function of the slowly varying drifts and the correlation functions of the random, highly oscillatory surface ﬂows.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction  Water wave dynamics are altered by interactions with spatially varying surface ﬂows.\n",
      "The surface ﬂows modify the free surface boundary conditions that determine the dis- persion for propagating water waves.\n",
      "The eﬀect of smoothly varying (compared to the wavelength) currents have been analysed using ray theory (Peregrine (1976), Jonsson (1990)) and the principle of conservation of wave action (CWA) (cf.\n",
      "Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), White (1999), Whitham (1974) and references within).\n",
      "These studies have largely focussed on long ocean gravity waves propagating over even larger scale spatially varying drifts.\n",
      "Water waves can also scatter from regions of un- derlying vorticity regions smaller than the wavelength Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994) and Cerda & Lund (1993).\n",
      "Boundary conditions that vary on capillary length scales, as well as wave interactions with structures comparable to or smaller than the wavelength can also lead to wave scattering (Chou, Lucas & Stone (1995), Gou, Messiter & Schultz (1993)), attenuation (Chou & Nelson (1994), Lee et al.\n",
      "(1993)), and Bragg reﬂections (Chou (1998), Naciri & Mei (1988)).\n",
      "Nonetheless, water wave propagation over random              \f",
      "2  Bal & Chou  static underlying currents that vary on both large and small length scales, and their interactions, have received relatively less attention.\n",
      "In this paper, we will only consider static irrotational currents, but derive the transport equations for surface waves in the presence of underlying ﬂows that vary on both long and short (on the order of the wavelength) length scales.\n",
      "Rather than computing wave scattering from speciﬁc static ﬂow conﬁgurations (Gerber (1993), Trulson & Mei (1993), Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994)), we take a statistical approach by considering ensemble averages over realisations of the static randomness.\n",
      "Diﬀerent statistical approaches have been applied to wave propagation over a random depth (Elter & Molyneux (1972)), third sound localization in superﬂuid Helium ﬁlms (Kleinert (1990)), and wave diﬀusion in the presence of turbulent ﬂows (Howe (1973), Rayevskiy (1983), Fannjiang & Ryzhik (1999)).\n",
      "In the next section we derive the linearised capillary-gravity wave equations to low- est order in the irrotational surface ﬂow.\n",
      "The ﬂuid mechanical boundary conditions are reduced to two partial diﬀerential equations that couple the surface height to velocity potential at the free surface.\n",
      "We treat only the “high frequency” limit (Ryzhik, Papani- colaou, & Keller (1996)) where wavelengths are much smaller than wave propagation dis- tances under consideration.\n",
      "In Section 3, we introduce the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) which represents the wave energy density and allows us to treat surface currents that vary simultaneously on two separated length scales.\n",
      "The dynamical equations developed in section 2 are then written in terms of an evolution equation for W. Upon expanding W in powers of wavelength/propagation distance, we obtain transport equations.\n",
      "In Section 4, we present our main mathematical result, equation (4.1), an equation describing the transport of surface wave action.\n",
      "Appendix A gives details of some of the derivation.\n",
      "The transport equation includes advection by the slowly varying drift, plus scattering terms that are functions of the correlations of the rapidly varying drift, representing water wave scattering.\n",
      "Upon simultaneously treating both smoothly varying and rapidly varying ﬂows using a two-scale expansion, we ﬁnd that scattering from rapidly varying ﬂows depends parametrically on the smoothly varying ﬂows.\n",
      "In the Results and Discussion, we discuss the regimes of validity, consider speciﬁc forms for the correlation functions, and detail the conditions for doppler coupling.\n",
      "CWA is extended to include rapidly varying drift provided that the correlations of the drift satisfy certain constraints.\n",
      "We also physically motivate the reason for considering two scales for the underlying drift.\n",
      "In the limit of still larger propagation distances, after multiple wave scattering, wave propagation leaves the transport regime and becomes diﬀusive (Sheng (1995)).\n",

      "Using the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at position x contained in waves with wavevector k, we describe surface wave transport over static ﬂows consisting of two length scales; one varying smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale com- parable to the wavelength.\n",
      "The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface ﬂows augment the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions of the cor- relations of the random surface currents.\n",
      "These scattering terms depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism.\n",
      "The Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modiﬁes the scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths with short wavelengths.\n",
      "Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying ﬂow.\n",
      "At yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an equation for wave energy diﬀusion.\n",
      "The associated diﬀusion constant is also expressed in terms of the surface ﬂow correlations.\n",
      "Our results provide a formal set of equations to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity, energy, and wave scattering as a function of the slowly varying drifts and the correlation functions of the random, highly oscillatory surface ﬂows.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction  Water wave dynamics are altered by interactions with spatially varying surface ﬂows.\n",
      "The surface ﬂows modify the free surface boundary conditions that determine the dis- persion for propagating water waves.\n",
      "The eﬀect of smoothly varying (compared to the wavelength) currents have been analysed using ray theory (Peregrine (1976), Jonsson (1990)) and the principle of conservation of wave action (CWA) (cf.\n",
      "Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), White (1999), Whitham (1974) and references within).\n",
      "These studies have largely focussed on long ocean gravity waves propagating over even larger scale spatially varying drifts.\n",
      "Water waves can also scatter from regions of un- derlying vorticity regions smaller than the wavelength Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994) and Cerda & Lund (1993).\n",
      "Boundary conditions that vary on capillary length scales, as well as wave interactions with structures comparable to or smaller than the wavelength can also lead to wave scattering (Chou, Lucas & Stone (1995), Gou, Messiter & Schultz (1993)), attenuation (Chou & Nelson (1994), Lee et al.\n",
      "(1993)), and Bragg reﬂections (Chou (1998), Naciri & Mei (1988)).\n",
      "Nonetheless, water wave propagation over random              \f",
      "2  Bal & Chou  static underlying currents that vary on both large and small length scales, and their interactions, have received relatively less attention.\n",
      "In this paper, we will only consider static irrotational currents, but derive the transport equations for surface waves in the presence of underlying ﬂows that vary on both long and short (on the order of the wavelength) length scales.\n",
      "Rather than computing wave scattering from speciﬁc static ﬂow conﬁgurations (Gerber (1993), Trulson & Mei (1993), Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994)), we take a statistical approach by considering ensemble averages over realisations of the static randomness.\n",
      "Diﬀerent statistical approaches have been applied to wave propagation over a random depth (Elter & Molyneux (1972)), third sound localization in superﬂuid Helium ﬁlms (Kleinert (1990)), and wave diﬀusion in the presence of turbulent ﬂows (Howe (1973), Rayevskiy (1983), Fannjiang & Ryzhik (1999)).\n",
      "In the next section we derive the linearised capillary-gravity wave equations to low- est order in the irrotational surface ﬂow.\n",
      "The ﬂuid mechanical boundary conditions are reduced to two partial diﬀerential equations that couple the surface height to velocity potential at the free surface.\n",
      "We treat only the “high frequency” limit (Ryzhik, Papani- colaou, & Keller (1996)) where wavelengths are much smaller than wave propagation dis- tances under consideration.\n",
      "In Section 3, we introduce the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) which represents the wave energy density and allows us to treat surface currents that vary simultaneously on two separated length scales.\n",
      "The dynamical equations developed in section 2 are then written in terms of an evolution equation for W. Upon expanding W in powers of wavelength/propagation distance, we obtain transport equations.\n",
      "In Section 4, we present our main mathematical result, equation (4.1), an equation describing the transport of surface wave action.\n",
      "Appendix A gives details of some of the derivation.\n",
      "The transport equation includes advection by the slowly varying drift, plus scattering terms that are functions of the correlations of the rapidly varying drift, representing water wave scattering.\n",
      "Upon simultaneously treating both smoothly varying and rapidly varying ﬂows using a two-scale expansion, we ﬁnd that scattering from rapidly varying ﬂows depends parametrically on the smoothly varying ﬂows.\n",
      "In the Results and Discussion, we discuss the regimes of validity, consider speciﬁc forms for the correlation functions, and detail the conditions for doppler coupling.\n",

      "Capillary-gravity wave transport over spatially random drift  By G U I L L A U M E B A L∗ and T O M C H O U† ∗ Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL†Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA (Received 2 February 2008)  We derive transport equations for the propagation of water wave action in the pres- ence of a static, spatially random surface drift.\n",
      "Using the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at position x contained in waves with wavevector k, we describe surface wave transport over static ﬂows consisting of two length scales; one varying smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale com- parable to the wavelength.\n",
      "The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface ﬂows augment the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions of the cor- relations of the random surface currents.\n",
      "These scattering terms depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism.\n",
      "The Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modiﬁes the scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths with short wavelengths.\n",
      "Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying ﬂow.\n",
      "At yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an equation for wave energy diﬀusion.\n",
      "The associated diﬀusion constant is also expressed in terms of the surface ﬂow correlations.\n",
      "Our results provide a formal set of equations to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity, energy, and wave scattering as a function of the slowly varying drifts and the correlation functions of the random, highly oscillatory surface ﬂows.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Introduction  Water wave dynamics are altered by interactions with spatially varying surface ﬂows.\n",
      "The surface ﬂows modify the free surface boundary conditions that determine the dis- persion for propagating water waves.\n",
      "The eﬀect of smoothly varying (compared to the wavelength) currents have been analysed using ray theory (Peregrine (1976), Jonsson (1990)) and the principle of conservation of wave action (CWA) (cf.\n",
      "Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), White (1999), Whitham (1974) and references within).\n",
      "These studies have largely focussed on long ocean gravity waves propagating over even larger scale spatially varying drifts.\n",
      "Water waves can also scatter from regions of un- derlying vorticity regions smaller than the wavelength Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994) and Cerda & Lund (1993).\n",
      "Boundary conditions that vary on capillary length scales, as well as wave interactions with structures comparable to or smaller than the wavelength can also lead to wave scattering (Chou, Lucas & Stone (1995), Gou, Messiter & Schultz (1993)), attenuation (Chou & Nelson (1994), Lee et al.\n",
      "(1993)), and Bragg reﬂections (Chou (1998), Naciri & Mei (1988)).\n",
      "Nonetheless, water wave propagation over random               Bal & Chou  static underlying currents that vary on both large and small length scales, and their interactions, have received relatively less attention.\n",
      "In this paper, we will only consider static irrotational currents, but derive the transport equations for surface waves in the presence of underlying ﬂows that vary on both long and short (on the order of the wavelength) length scales.\n",
      "Rather than computing wave scattering from speciﬁc static ﬂow conﬁgurations (Gerber (1993), Trulson & Mei (1993), Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994)), we take a statistical approach by considering ensemble averages over realisations of the static randomness.\n",
      "Diﬀerent statistical approaches have been applied to wave propagation over a random depth (Elter & Molyneux (1972)), third sound localization in superﬂuid Helium ﬁlms (Kleinert (1990)), and wave diﬀusion in the presence of turbulent ﬂows (Howe (1973), Rayevskiy (1983), Fannjiang & Ryzhik (1999)).\n",
      "In the next section we derive the linearised capillary-gravity wave equations to low- est order in the irrotational surface ﬂow.\n",
      "The ﬂuid mechanical boundary conditions are reduced to two partial diﬀerential equations that couple the surface height to velocity potential at the free surface.\n",
      "We treat only the “high frequency” limit (Ryzhik, Papani- colaou, & Keller (1996)) where wavelengths are much smaller than wave propagation dis- tances under consideration.\n",
      "In Section 3, we introduce the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t) which represents the wave energy density and allows us to treat surface currents that vary simultaneously on two separated length scales.\n",
      "The dynamical equations developed in section 2 are then written in terms of an evolution equation for W. Upon expanding W in powers of wavelength/propagation distance, we obtain transport equations.\n",
      "In Section 4, we present our main mathematical result, equation (4.1), an equation describing the transport of surface wave action.\n",
      "Appendix A gives details of some of the derivation.\n",
      "The transport equation includes advection by the slowly varying drift, plus scattering terms that are functions of the correlations of the rapidly varying drift, representing water wave scattering.\n",
      "Upon simultaneously treating both smoothly varying and rapidly varying ﬂows using a two-scale expansion, we ﬁnd that scattering from rapidly varying ﬂows depends parametrically on the smoothly varying ﬂows.\n",
      "In the Results and Discussion, we discuss the regimes of validity, consider speciﬁc forms for the correlation functions, and detail the conditions for doppler coupling.\n",
      "CWA is extended to include rapidly varying drift provided that the correlations of the drift satisfy certain constraints.\n",
      "We also physically motivate the reason for considering two scales for the underlying drift.\n",
      "In the limit of still larger propagation distances, after multiple wave scattering, wave propagation leaves the transport regime and becomes diﬀusive (Sheng (1995)).\n",
